## Why Wiziplicity?

We were in a VC whilst trying to come up with names for this mod. We thought up the name "System Helper" however we thought this would be confusing for singlets.

Another person said Wizzerd, a misspelling of Wizard and a reference to the Discworld book series.

From wizard, which is a program which helps the user through a complex process, the mod name Wiziplicity was suggested, a combination of wizard and multiplicity.
